        <h2>The Homilies of Deacon Frank</h2>
        <p>In his 20 years as an ordained Deacon of the Roman Catholic Church, Deacon Frank’s greatest passion
          and his greatest gift was sharing the Word of the Lord.

          Before Frank returned to the Lord, we are fortunate that he was able to share his saved speaking notes for
          almost 500 sermons that he delivered through the years. Some of these sermons were delivered to an
          overflowing church on Easter Sunday. Others were delivered to a bare handful at a makeshift Mass in a
          small classroom while on mission in the Bahamas. However, all of these sermons were delivered with a
          passion to share the Word of God with any that would listen.

          This is a record of the speaking notes Deacon Frank made for himself to present his homilies. We
          unfortunately do not have any recordings or transcripts that would give us the gift of hearing his voice.
          What we do have are the speaking notes he used to share the insights he offered into the Readings of the
          day.

          While we can not hear the stories Deacon Frank told us on Sunday’s, hopefully the opportunity to see into
          his speaking notes will provide you with a chance to gain an insight into that day’s Readings that you may
          not have had. Deacon Frank’s personal notes are provided here for all to have an opportunity to continue to
          learn from his unique way of spreading The Word.</p>

        <h2>Obituary for Deacon Francis "Frank" R. Tremblay</h2>
        <p>TREMBLAY, FRANCIS R. “Deacon Frank” of Stoughton passed away on January 31, 2025 at the age of
          75. Beloved husband of the late Virginia “Ginni” M. (Caldwell) Tremblay. Devoted father of Matthew D.
          Tremblay and his wife Melissa of Kingwood, TX, Michael F. Tremblay and his wife Catherine of East
          Hampton, NY and Joseph D. Tremblay and his wife Liza of Sag Harbor, NY. Brother of Rosanna Kenney of
          Dracut and Mary Burke of Methuen. Cherished grandfather of Jack Christopher Tremblay, Leo John
          Tremblay, Rose W. Tremblay and Henri S. Tremblay. Also survived by many nieces and nephews. Son of
          the late Leo J. and Gloria A. (Boucher) Tremblay.
          Frank was a proud graduate of Boston College and had a long career in technology while living with his
          family in Canton, MA. Always a devout Catholic, Frank was an active member of the New Jerusalem
          Charismatic Prayer Group, meeting at St. Timothy’s Parish in Norwood for 40 years. In 2002 he was
          ordained a Deacon and transitioned from a career in technology to managing the Sacred Hearts Retreat
          Center in Wareham. Upon retiring, Frank and his wife Ginni moved to Andros Island in the Bahamas where
          they established a Catholic ministry and served the community for seven years. They were forced to return
          to the US when Ginni began to show the signs of Alzheimer’s and Frank cared for her at their home in
          Stoughton for many years while ministering at Our Lady of Sorrows in Sharon, the Chaplain at the Nassau
          Street Jail, and finally as deacon at St. Catherine’s of Siena in Norwood. He was blessed to live a life
          touched by many wonderful friends and was especially fortunate to have found Dr. Marjorie Goodwin who
          was a cherished companion after the death of his wife and supported him through his battle with cancer.</p>
